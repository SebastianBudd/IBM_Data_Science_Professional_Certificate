This repository contains all the files created formy final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
This includes the notebook and report for my project

My project used density based clustering and statistical analysis to determine the best place to open a new Korean restaurant in West London.
It used data from the Foursquare API.

In addition I wrote a medium blogpost describing the process here https://medium.com/@sebastianbudd/the-battle-of-the-neighbourhoods-951226be032b
